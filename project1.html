      <h2>Trader Joe’s — <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.traderjoes.com/</a></h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Business evaluated: Trader Joe’s (grocery retailer). Below are my critique responses in complete sentences.
      </p>

      <div class="answers">
        <p><strong>1) First impression:</strong> My first impression was that the site feels friendly and brand-focused, with a lot of emphasis on Trader Joe’s personality and featured content rather than looking like a typical “big box” grocery website.</p>

        <p><strong>2) Information flow:</strong> The information is organized mainly through top navigation and content blocks that guide you to common tasks like finding stores, reading announcements, and browsing featured items, so it feels like a hub that points you to the next click.</p>

        <p><strong>3) Overall structure:</strong> The structure mostly makes sense because the main categories are grouped in a way that matches what customers usually want (store info, news/updates, and company info), although the site can feel content-heavy if you are searching for one specific thing quickly.</p>

        <p><strong>4) Visual design and media:</strong> The graphics and layout generally enhance the experience because they match the Trader Joe’s brand and make the site feel upbeat, but the design can sometimes feel busy since there are many sections competing for attention on the page.</p>

        <p><strong>5) Load time:</strong> I cannot measure the exact number of seconds in this document, but when I visited the homepage it loaded in a reasonable amount of time and did not feel slow or frustrating on a normal connection.</p>

        <p><strong>6) Readability:</strong> The text is readable overall because the font sizes are large enough and the color contrast is decent, and the background styling supports the content rather than making the text hard to see.</p>

        <p><strong>7) Navigation quality:</strong> The site uses a clear navigation system (including top-level navigation and links within sections), and it is fairly well done because it helps you jump to key areas without needing to scroll forever.</p>

        <p><strong>8) Consistency:</strong> The look-and-feel is consistent across pages because the branding, typography style, and general layout patterns repeat, which makes the site feel connected and not like a bunch of unrelated pages.</p>

        <p><strong>9) Smaller screens:</strong> When the window is smaller, the layout adjusts so the content stacks more vertically, which helps it stay usable and prevents the page from becoming unreadable on smaller screens.</p>

        <p><strong>10) Something unusual or very well done:</strong> One thing the site does well is keeping a strong “Trader Joe’s voice” throughout the experience, which makes the site feel more like part of the brand instead of a generic corporate grocery website.</p>
