  <h1>Tributes: Rent A Pet</h1>

  <p>
    These tributes share real stories from customers who have enjoyed the companionship, fun,

  <h2>A Weekly Walk to Look Forward To</h2>

       width="___" height="___"
       class="img-right">

  <p>
    My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that has a prohibition on pets.
    I really wanted to have a small dog that I could take out for walks, but I thought it was not possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I heard about Rent A Pet and I was excited to give it a try. I found a loveable bassett hound and met
    her when she was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    We went through a long walk in the nearby park and had a wonderful time. The great Rent A Pet staff came and
    picked her up two hours later and I didn't even have to worry about feeding or watering "Sophie".
  </p>

  <p>
    We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, if the weather permits. I know I look forward to getting in
    my weekly walk in the park and I imagine Sophie likes it as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week,
  </p>

  <p>
    Yours,<br>
    Bessie Anderson

  <h2>Finding a Running Buddy and a Fiancé</h2>

       alt="A dog outdoors and ready to run"
       width="___" height="___"
       class="img-left">

  <p>
    I'm a single college guy and live in an apartment with 3 other guys. I always wanted to have a large breed of dog
    that would be a companion to take running or play catch with in the park.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamaikaze, a German Shephard. He loves to run in the summer and even cross
    country ski in the winter.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best thing Kazi likes to do is play Frisbee and run through an obstacle course. I always attract the attention
    of girls in the park when we go there.
  </p>

  <p>
    I even met my fiance, Janice, when she joined Kazi and me in a heated game of keep away. One day I will have a home
    where I can have a yard to keep my own dog. Until that time, I can still enjoy the companionship of a good dog.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks to Rent A Pet,
  </p>

  <h2>Exotic Pets Without the Responsibility</h2>

  <img src="Images1/BirdDogSmall.jpg"
       alt="An unusual pet experience with Rent A Pet"
       width="___" height="___"
       class="img-right">

  <p>
    My business requires me to travel quite a bit. So it would be hard for me to own a pet of my own. I would have to
    constantly find someone to pet sit, or I would have to pay for boarding the pet.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also like to surprise and shock my friends with my unusual pets. Rent A Pet is a perfect solution for my lifestyle.
    I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot belly pig and an iguana.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know my nurturing skills are sadly lacking because I cannot even keep a house plant alive. I can have fun with exotic
    pets without having the worry about keeping them healthy and happy. Thanks for adding spice to my life.

  <h2>A Dream Come True on the Trails</h2>

  <img src="Images1/Horse2.jpg"
       alt="A horse ready for a trail ride"
       width="___" height="___"
       class="img-left">

  <p>
    As a young girl, I developed a love of horses. But I grew up in the city and never had the chance to own my own horse.
    I was delighted to find Rent A Pet.
  </p>

  <p>
    They have several horses to choose from for riders of different levels. They will deliver the horse to the trail where I
    want to ride.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because I can request the same horse time after time, I have become very comfortable with my skills and the abilities of
    the horse I ride. I would never be able to provide room and board for my own animal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for making a dream come true,
  </p>

  <p>
